# 🤖 AI Virtual Twin Chatbot

*AI Virtual Twin* is a personalized chatbot that mimics your texting style based on your own messages. It provides dynamic, human-like responses using your chat samples, giving the feel of chatting with your virtual self.

### 🧠 What I’ve Done:
- Built a *Flask-based web application* that runs a real-time chatbot.
- Trained the bot using a custom dataset (my_chats.txt) containing sample user messages.
- Designed a *clean and interactive UI* using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Added *voice input functionality* using Web Speech API for hands-free chatting.
- Created a *beautiful landing page* with full-screen background and “Get Started” interface.
- Implemented session-based *chat history*, so conversations don’t disappear on refresh.

> This project is designed to reflect how you chat — making your virtual twin feel more real and personalized.
